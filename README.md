# Udacity Readable

For the Readable project, I built a content and comment web app. Users are able
to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other
users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit
and delete posts and comments.

## Running the project

* Install and start the API server
  * `cd api-server`
  * `npm install`
  * `node server`
* In another terminal window start the frontend
  * `cd frontend`
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
